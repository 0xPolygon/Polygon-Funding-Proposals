# PFP-1: Polygon Funding Proposal Framework


## Abstract

The Community Treasury is an in-protocol fund independent from Polygon Labs (and other Polygon entities), governed via a framework that aims to enable community participation. It is designed and introduced to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. 

Funded via a dedicated POL token emission stream, the Treasury provides strong ecosystem support during the period of early adoption, which is critical for the development, growth, and positioning of the Polygon ecosystem.

Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs), in turn, help govern the Community Treasury openly and transparently, describing processes and templates.


## Rationale

In a self-sustainable and decentralized ecosystem, a framework is necessary to help gradually direct the value created by the network in a community-centered fashion. By introducing a transparent and versioned repository, the community maintains a historical record of the Community Treasury-related operations.  \
 \
The main discussion space for all PFPs is the [Polygon Community Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/c/pfp/89). Feedback from the forum will be incorporated into the documented PFPs housed in the Github repository.


## Specification

A PFP is a formal proposal proposing changes to the Community Treasury’s governance processes - anyone can submit a PFP, which is the first step towards building consensus.


### PFP Types

Two PFP types are distinguished:



* Informational: Proposals introducing or improving new or existing processes in the functioning of the Community Treasury. 
* Treasury Board: Proposals aimed at introducing changes to the Community Treasury Board membership. 

For a more detailed description of the roles, responsibilities, and templates, see [PFP-2](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-02.md) and [PFP-3](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-03.md). In the initial phase of the PFP framework, only Treasury Board proposals will be merged into the repository. As the Community Treasury evolves, other types of PFPs may be proposed, e.g., funding proposals.


### PFP Flow

Polygon Funding Proposals progress through five possible states:


#### Proposed

Initial PFPs should be posted to the Polygon community forum for community discussion and feedback, alongside a Pull Request to the PFP repository. Authors should ensure their proposals align with designated categories and standards laid out in this PFP, as well as other process PFPs like PFP-2 and PFP-3. Authors are responsible for inviting interested parties to the forum discussion and responding to suggestions.

Should the document require amendments, the PFP editors will work with the author to make any necessary changes. The author is then responsible for amending the document and resubmitting the request. Once all issues are resolved, the Pull Request will be accepted to the PFP Github repository, and the PFP will be assigned a number.


#### Review

Once a PFP has been added to the PFP Github repository, it can be more formally discussed, circulated, and ultimately evaluated by the Community Treasury Board. PFPs in a review state will be announced in the community Discord and other communication channels to maximize awareness. Authors should be available for any public discussions related to their proposals.


#### Accepted

A PFP approved using one of the relevant consensus mechanisms will be marked as accepted. 


#### Rejected

PFPs that fail to gather the necessary consensus are marked as rejected and may be resubmitted with modifications in the future. 


#### Archived

Outdated proposals may be moved into an archival state but will remain in the repository. 


### PFP Body

PFPs should contain the following:

**Title:** The Title of the PFP should be concise and accurately explain the purpose of the PFP.

**Status:** 1 of 5 statuses for the PFP, described in the PFP Flow section.

**Abstract:** A short (~200 word) summary of the proposal.

**Specification:** The specification should provide the reader an in-depth understanding of the proposal.


### PFP Editors

PFP editors are responsible for ensuring that PFP submissions are properly structured and advanced through designated stages. They are also responsible for ensuring that submissions are logically and reasonably structured. Editors should check the PFP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.). If the PFP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions. Once the PFP has satisfied the above requirements, a PFP editor will upload the proposal to the GitHub repository.


#### Designated Editors

The current PFP editors are comprised of:



* [Kaitlin Beegle](https://github.com/kaitlin-beegle)
* [Harry Rook]((https://github.com/hrook1)
* Mattie Fairchild
* Rohit Chauhan
