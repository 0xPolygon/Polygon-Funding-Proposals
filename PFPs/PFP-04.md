# PFP-4: Update to CTB Member List


## Abstract

This PFP proposes an amendment to the current membership of the Community Treasury Board (CTB).  


## Rationale

The Community Treasury Board (CTB) was first initiated approximately one year ago (see: [PFP-03](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-03.md)), with a membership of 5 people. 

The purpose of this PFP is to propose an updated list of CTB members.  It does **not** propose a change to the number of seats and/or the configuration of the Treasury multisigs.

### Amendment to Treasury Multisig
