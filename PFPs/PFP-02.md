# PFP-2: Community Treasury Board

## Abstract

This proposal establishes the Community Treasury Board (CTB) as an independent governance body responsible for executive oversight of the Polygon Community Treasury. It defines the core responsibilities and obligations of the CTB, as well as the primary mechanisms through which it achieves its mandate.

## Specification

### Purpose and Function

The CTB is an independent expert body which supports the governance and operations of the Polygon Community Treasury.  It is primarily responsible for ensuring that Treasury operations are transparent and accountable, and that Treasury resources are strategically allocated in support of the vision and values of the Polygon network.

The Community Treasury Board is empowered to enforce governance, operational, and strategic standards via control of a multisig that is necessary to approve the allocation of Treasury funds.

### Membership

The CTB is comprised of thought leaders and experts in ecosystem growth and grant operations. Members must be familiar with ecosystem trends and opportunities and be able to formulate a compelling thesis to support their strategic decisions.

Minimum qualifications for membership include:

1. ***Values Alignment*** — Members should be aligned with the vision of the Polygon network and champions of the Ethereum ethos. They are proponents of responsible decentralization, self-sovereignty, and unconstrained access to the Internet of Value.  
2. ***Ecosystem Growth Expertise*** — Members are deeply familiar with the dynamics, challenges, and demands of growing decentralized ecosystems, and have proven knowledge of *and/or* direct leadership experience in other successful blockchain ecosystem(s).  
3. ***Specific Field Expertise*** — Members must demonstrate subject-matter expertise and/or a professional track record that will enable them to contribute in an executive capacity to all critical functional areas in which the Board is expected to operate.  
4. ***Community Expertise*** — Members should be able to demonstrate a particular knowledge of and/or familiarity with the Polygon ecosystem, and should be able to articulate strategies for sustainably stewarding the sustainable growth of multistakeholder environments.  
5. ***Operational Expertise*** — Members must have the capacity- including both skills and time- to execute the operations of the Board.  This includes reviewing documentation, participating in meetings and async conversations, securely maintaining a multisignature address, signing transactions, and providing executive guidance on a range of topics and issue areas.

For a list of current and/or past CTB Members, please see [PFP-03](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-03.md).

#### Adding & Removing Members

Membership of the CTB is controlled via on- and off-chain mechanisms.  This includes administrative access to meetings and restricted communications channels, as well as control over the CTB multisig. As such, the CTB is empowered to self-govern its membership.

To add a Member, a proposal should be brought to the current Board for review and consideration.  This may include a resume review, interviews, or other vetting mechanisms.  When at least 3/5 members agree to add the proposed Member, an updated version of [PFP-03](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-03.md) should be pushed to the repo and the requested change should be flagged in the [Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/c/community-treasury/94).  Following completion of the PFP process outlined in [PFP-01](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-01.md), existing CTB Members are responsible for ensuring the onboarding of the new Member.

Whenever a Member is no longer able to fulfill their obligations, they are welcome to resign from their role.  In this case, the Board is required to find and add a replacement Member, or else reasonably argue for the modification of the current multisig parameters.

If ever there is a loss of confidence about a Members' ability to perform in their role, the Board is able to vote on their removal.  In this instance, a vote of 3/5 (consistent with the current signature policy) is required in order to remove the contested Member.  If the Member is removed, the remaining Board members are likewise required to fill their seat with a new Member, or else formally modify the multisig parameters via a PFP.

#### Additional Operational Support

As the founding institution and lead steward of the Polygon network, Polygon Labs provides direct support resources to aid in the operation of the Board. This includes allocating support staff to the Board, and building, maintaining, and/or funding technical infrastructure that is necessary for the Board and Treasury to operate securely.

#### Compensation to Members

CTB Members currently each receive a monthly payment equal to $5,000 USD, payable in POL, from the Community Treasury, calculated using the [Coingecko Historical POL Close Price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon-ecosystem-token/historical_data) as of the last day of each month (or a pro-rata portion thereof for any partial month service).

### Board Responsibilities

The Community Treasury Board is required to fulfil the following mandatory obligations:

#### Strategy Setting

On a semi-annual basis, the Community Treasury Board will publish a six (6) month funding strategy.  This strategy will be published as a Funding PFP and must contain the following information:

* ***Executive Strategy*** \- A high-level overview of the motivation and scope of funding for the upcoming six (6) month Strategy Period, highlighting critical initiatives, areas of impact, and other priorities that the CTB is expressly interested in prioritizing.  
* ***Designation of Funds*** \- In alignment with the Executive Strategy, Funds are the general funding categories that directly support critical focus areas identified by the CTB.  Funds can be specified in any way that the CTB deems fit, though it is advised that funds are differentiated by 1\) funding mechanism(s), 2\) impact type, and/or 3\) project type.  Each Fund represents a single pool of funds that will be allocated by the Treasury for the upcoming six (6) month period.  
* ***Designation of Programs*** \- Programs are funding initiatives that are executed within Funds. They have a narrower focus, application, and/or funding mechanism, and work in a specific way to support the objectives of the Fund. For example, there may be a Hackathon Developer Grant (Program) that is specified within the Community Engagement & Development (Fund).  
* ***Identification of Program Directors and Other Responsible Parties*** \- Program Directors are the primary points-of-contact responsible for defining and/or managing a Program.  The CTB is responsible for publicly naming Project Director(s), as well as any partners or additional parties that may be critical points-of-contact for the success of a given Program or Fund.  
* ***Preliminary Budget Allocations*** \- The CTB is obligated to report a top-line budget allocation that it can report progress and expenditures against at the end of the given Strategy Period. The CTB must publish its planned and non-fungible allocation for all Funds, as well as suggested allocations for each Program.  
* ***Fund and Program Reporting Requirements*** \- For each Fund and Program, the CTB will outline reporting standards that will be used to determine impact at the end of the Strategy period.  This may include the identification of specific impact measurements, performance benchmarks, and/or measurement tools and mechanisms for a given Fund and/or Program.  It may also include rules about frequency and openness of reporting requirements.

Strategies must also disclose addresses for any wallets that primarily receive or control Treasury allocations on behalf of a Fund or Program.

Once a Strategy is published, the Board is obligated to adhere to the structure and budget parameters which it has set forth. Changes to Fund designations and budgets- including the redistribution of the budget across Funds- is highly discouraged.  In instances where these changes are deemed necessary, the Board should move forward with unanimous support among Members.  Any desired changes will only be considered 'in effect' once the Strategy has been amended via the PFP process, which requires a minimum of two weeks.

#### Treasury Allocations

The CTB executes Treasury allocations via a SAFE multisig mechanism.

As outlined in [PIP-40](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-40.md), the workflow features a non-upgradeable OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes contract which produces 100 voting tokens and distributes them across two contracts.

These contracts are further distinguished, with one operating as `Proposer` and the other operating as `Executor`.

- 50.00000001 tokens are distributed to the `Proposer` SAFE (`0x2ff25495d77f380d5F65B95F103181aE8b1cf898`) wallet, operated by Polygon Labs  
- 49.99999999 tokens are distributed to the `Executor` ⅗ consensus multisig wallet (`0xb7b02DbC9D054A8BA90b2172B4f8d2D79aC7d3a0`), operated by the Community Treasury Board

In this structure, the `Proposer` is responsible for creating proposals and structuring transactions, which the `Executor` must then review and approve. The ERC20 voting mechanism specifies that consensus is only reached when 100 tokens are allocated in favor of a proposal, meaning that both wallets must vote 'Yes' in order for the allocation to occur.

This setup ensures that Polygon Labs can assist the Community Treasury Board with day-to-day administrative and other non-managerial operations without compromising the independence of the Treasury.  Polygon Labs cannot singlehandedly execute any transaction without the CTB's on-chain approval.

The above technical parameters were implemented via [PIP-40](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-40.md).  Prior to this, Board Treasury management was defined by specifications set forth in [PIP-17](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-17.md).

#### Review and Analysis of Strategic Allocations

On a quarterly basis, the Community Treasury Board will publish a review and analysis of its recent work and current strategy.

At a minimum, this report must be made public, and should include updates on current budget allocations and known impact metrics.  The Board is also encouraged to include analysis on emerging strategic interests and/or shifting priorities.

Given the quarterly nature of the reporting, it is expected that reports will occur at the halfway point and conclusion of each Strategy period.

#### Ad Hoc Direct Funding Requests and Allocations

Given the volatile nature of the blockchain space, a situation may arise in which the Board is asked to consider an immediate Treasury request that falls outside the bounds of its current budget and/or Strategy.

Critically, the purpose of the Board is to enforce governance standards upon the Treasury and community, and to ensure that all allocations are strategically aligned with the long-term interests of the Polygon ecosystem.  As such, ad hoc funding requests can be reviewed, but are highly discouraged.

In instances wherein a request is made, the Board should:

* Publicly disclose the request, as well as reasons for and against supporting it.  
  * The Board may request community feedback about whether or not to approve the request, but it does not require it.  
* Seek unanimous consent among Members in order to approve the allocation.  
* Borrow money from future budgets in order to cover the cost of the requests.  
* Accept public responsibility and primary accountability for the impact of the spending.

The above is written as guiding suggestions rather than requirements.  In the case of a true emergency, the Board is empowered and able to directly allocate the $POL that it controls.
