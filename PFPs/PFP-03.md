In support of the Polygon Community Treasury, a governing body in the form of a Community Treasury Board (See [PFP-02](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-02.md)) is necessary to administer the operations, strategy, and transparency of the funding mechanism.

This document outlines the five (5) members that presently comprise the Board, as well as a list of prior members.
