# PFP-3: Initial Set of CTB Members


## Abstract

This PFP proposes five members to the inaugural Community Treasury Board. 


## Rationale

To bootstrap the initial phase of the Community Treasury, a governing body in the form of a Community Treasury Board (See [PFP-02](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-02.md)) is necessary to administer the operations, strategy, and transparency of the funding mechanism.

A set of five members with diverse backgrounds and skill sets is consequently proposed. 


## Specification


### Proposed CTB Members

Taking the above qualifications into account, a set of five initial members is proposed:
