# The Polygon Funding Proposal Repository

The Polygon Community Treasury is an in-protocol fund independent from Polygon Labs (and other Polygon entities), governed via a framework that aims to enable community participation. It is designed and introduced to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. 

In a self-sustainable and decentralized ecosystem, a framework is necessary to help gradually direct the value created by the network in a community-centered fashion. By introducing a transparent and versioned repository, the community maintains a historical record of the Community Treasury-related operations.
